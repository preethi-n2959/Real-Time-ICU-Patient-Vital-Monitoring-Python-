# Real-Time-ICU-Patient-Vital-Monitoring-Python-
This project is a simulation-based mini project that demonstrates how real-time patient vitals can be streamed, monitored, and analyzed using reactive programming in Python.

## Problem Context
In ICU environments, patient vitals must be monitored continuously.
This project focuses on the **system design aspect** of real-time monitoring,
not medical diagnosis.

## Features
- Real-time streaming of patient vitals (synthetic data)
- Event-based alert generation
- Batch-level analytics on streams
- Live dashboard visualization

## Tech Stack
- Python
- RxPy (Reactive Extensions)
- Pandas
- Plotly

## Disclaimer
⚠️ This project uses **synthetic data** and is **not intended for clinical use**.

## Why this project?
Built as a learning exercise to understand:
- Streaming data pipelines
- Event-driven architectures
- Real-time analytics in healthcare-inspired systems

## Possible Extensions
- Replace synthetic data with public datasets
- Add anomaly detection models
- Deploy using Streamlit
